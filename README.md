# Albertsune's Reapack Scripts

Hi. This is where you find my reascripts. Most are probably meant to be used for Trombone Champ charting, if you don't know what that is ~~_why are you even here_~~ there's probably not much of interest here.


## Installation

These scripts are all distributed through reapack, reapers package manager. You can find installation instruction here: <https://reapack.com/>

Once you have this, simply import my repository with this link: 
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sune-sje/Albertsune-Reapack-Scripts/master/index.xml>

And thats it!* Now search up whatever script you'd like through Reapack and run it through the action menu. Or make a keybind for it, all up to you


*"almost it". A few scripts needs some plugins to work, these will be stated in the following section. These are all part of Reapacks default repository, just search them up and install. You might need to restart Reaper afterwards


## Scripts

### Autospacing

Script for Trombone Champ that automatically does the spacing for all notes in selected midi takes.


### BonerViewer

> needs "js_ReaScriptAPI" and "ReaImGui" from the default Reateam Extension repository

Ever wanted to skip the process of exporting midi, convert it to tmb, and then preview it? Now you can!
BonerViewer will create a window showing how your chart would look in game. 

It even has an export function, of which you can edit the tmb's metadata and it'll be stored inside the project itself. Or, if you'd like, you can import it from an already existing tmb


## Notes

I am more than happy to take suggestions, contributions, pull requests, or a simple fuck you for making your life easier. Happy charting!
