# Albertsune's Reapack Scripts

Hi. This is where you find my reascripts. Most are probably meant to be used for Trombone Champ charting, if you don't know what that is ~~_why are you even here_~~ there's probably not much of interest here.

You can import the repository in Reapack with this link:

## Scripts

### Autospacing

Script for Trombone Champ that automatically does the spacing for all notes in selected midi takes.
