# Albertsune's Reapack Scripts

Hi! This is where you find my reascripts. Most are probably meant to be used for Trombone Champ charting, if you don't know what that is ~~_why are you even here_~~ there's probably not much of interest here, but feel free to look around.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

These scripts are distributed via **ReaPack**, REAPERâ€™s package manager. If you havenâ€™t installed it yet, follow the instructions here: [ReaPack Installation Guide](https://reapack.com/)

Once thatâ€™s set up, add my repository by importing this link into ReaPack:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sune-sje/Albertsune-Reapack-Scripts/master/index.xml
```

After that, you can find and install my scripts directly through **ReaPack**. Just search for the one you need, install it, and run it from the action menuâ€”or bind it to a hotkey if thatâ€™s your style.

âš  **Some scripts require additional dependencies!**  
These are all available in ReaPackâ€™s default repository. If a script needs anything extra, itâ€™ll be noted in the script descriptions below. You may need to restart REAPER after installing dependencies.

## ðŸŽ¼ Scripts

### **Autospacing**

Automatically spaces all notes in selected MIDI takes. It might not be perfect, especially for longer notes, but it's a great head start.

**Features:**  
âœ… Does all your spacing for you  
âœ… Doesn't touch your slides  

#### **Usage:**  
Select the MIDI takes you want to adjust, then run the script. It will analyze the note positions and update their lengths to hopefully achieve better spacing.  

### **BonerViewer**

ðŸ“Œ _Requires:_ `js_ReaScriptAPI` and `ReaImGui` from the default ReaTeam Extensions repository

Tired of manually exporting MIDI, converting to TMB, and only then previewing your chart? **BonerViewer** lets you preview your chart **inside REAPER**â€”no conversions needed.

**Features:**  
âœ… Live in-game-style preview of your chart  
âœ… Edit and store TMB metadata within the REAPER project  
âœ… Import metadata from an existing TMB file  
âœ… Export TMB directly from reaper, directly to where you'd like it

#### **Usage:**  
BonerViewer will open a window that previews all unmuted MIDI takes as they would appear in-game. This mimics the usual process of exporting the project MIDI, converting, and playing.  

In this window, you can also configure **TMB settings** and export the TMB file. If you prefer to skip the preview, these functions are also available separately in the action menu as:  
- `tmbSettings.lua` (for setting TMB metadata)  
- `ExportTmb.lua` (for exporting the TMB file)
